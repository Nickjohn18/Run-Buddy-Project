# Run-Buddy-Project
This project consists of matching runners with trainers. In this project, I had to make a webpage that will match runners with different trainers according to their needs. 
Using full name, email, and phone number, runners were allowed to sign up through the the sign-up sector of the webpage.
The webpage also listed different informations about the things the company do, trainers and other information about the program.
I briefly listed some of the trainers in different aspect of the program.
